# Tmog
Addon for TurtleWoW. Adds information about your transmog collection on item tooltips and an Item Browser where you can search and try on all items in the game (including shirts and tabards) and make outfits. This is work in progress, expect bugs and inaccuracies, report them [here](https://github.com/Otari98/Tmog/issues).<br><br>
Slash commands:<br>
/tmog show - toggles window<br>
/tmog reset - resets button position<br>
## Instruction
Download addon, extract into Interface/Addons, remove ```-master```, folder should be named Tmog.<br>

If this is first time using addon you need to cache your existing transmog collection, for that go to fashionista in Stormwind or Orgrimmar, click on every item slot, you need to do this for all weapon types (two-hand, polearms, staves, one-hand swords/axes/maces, daggers, shields, off-hand holdables, wands, crossbows, bows, guns)<br>
For example if you have transmogs for daggers and polearms, you need to equip any dagger, go to transmog npc and click on dagger, then equip any polearm, talk to npc again, click on polearm. Repeat for other weapon types that you have.
For armor slots clicking once should be enough.<br>

If you have multiple transmogged gear pieces for a given slot, you need to talk to fashionista while wearing each of these gear pieces, otherwise right click function in Tmog window will not work as you might expect it to work. Addon stores your transmog status for each item.

Note: some items can say they are not collected but when you equip them you arent getting "new transmog" alert, thats because you already have item with the same appearance in your collection. If you find some item that looks like other item and it shows incorrect info on tooltip, please let me know.
