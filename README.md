# Tmog
Addon for TurtleWoW. Adds information about your transmog collection on item tooltips. This is early version, expect bugs and inaccuracies, report them [here](https://github.com/Otari98/Tmog/issues).
## Instruction
Download addon, extract into Interface/Addons, remove ```-master```, folder should be named Tmog.<br>
If this is first time using addon you need to cache your existing transmog collection, for that go to fashionista in Stormwind or Orgrimmar, click on every item slot, you need to do this for all weapon types (tho-handed, polearms, swords/axes/maces, daggers, shields, off-hand holdables, wands, crossbows, bows, guns)<br>
For example if you have transmogs for daggers and polearms, you need to equip some dagger, go to tmog npc and click on dagger, then equip your polearm, talk to npc again, click on polearm. Repeat for other weapon types.
Note: some items can say they are not collected but when you equip them you arent getting "new transmog" alert, thats because you already have item with the same appearance in your collection. Im not sure how to fix this yet.
